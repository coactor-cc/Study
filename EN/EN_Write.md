## 写作
作文的准备思路，如果你备考都没有思路的话你也离g不远了 

回忆高中作文的比拼：还是要积累语料，但是有没有可能我太在意用词的独特性，没注意标点，语法，书写这些基础
我觉得在高级表达上，经过准备不会欠缺，但作文的基本东西还是很需要纠正的，
1.练字(每天20min)×时间不够
2.审题技术
3.素材积累->形成装逼的语言：aspect个人品质，社会文化，科技，环境  
4.实践：行文思路、语法纠正、时间把控->check 提升->实践

### 常犯错误
#### 低级错误
1主谓一致

2缺少谓语

3可数名词单数的冠词



5.单词拼写错误或生造词

### 高级错误
4介词使用不当

Dear Prof. James,

Words fail me in conveying my welcome to your arrival, and it is a great `privilege` to share a sought-after tourist attraction that may fascinate you.

The Great Wall, hailed as one of the world's greatest wonders, took shape over the course of generations of ancestors' efforts. `Amid` sightseeing, you will be immersed in the `sophisticated` ancient crafts and the painstaking efforts, which are bound to form a unique experience.  By the way, detailed English introduction is available from official websites.

I will be delighted if my humble recommendation counts.  Wish you a nice trip!

Sincerely  
Li Ming

The rose would have withstood the elements.  As the image explicitly portrays, the rose, guarded by the barrier, ~~loses~~has lost  her capability ~~of keeping~~to keeping body and soul together in nature. This suggests a not-to-be-negligible issue in the aspect of growth.

At first glance, this is merely `an` accident alone. Deep down, it mirrors a shared dilemma between basic support and overprotection. Admittedly, we can slavishly be in a rut of conventional orthodoxies, extolling the magnitude of painstaking care.  Nevertheless, no trumiphs can land without trial-and-error spirals, especially when it comes to breed ~~grits~~grit.  To gear up for the ~~required~~ experience required for survival, a wit, which sheds light on the margin of protection, promises to be vital in individual growth.

In a nutshell, the transition of era orders us to keep in line with ever-changing reality.  Specifically, in confronting the rub of undue protection, a becoming balance between helping hands and realistic lessons should take precedence over traditional single-protection.

The picture drips with sarcasm when it comes to how we treat our environment.The travellers are ~~throwing~~tossing trash around while boating on the lake,the remainders ~~flowing~~drifting ~~at~~on the surface.

Behind such `a` phenomenon lies in our lack of environmental awareness.~~People~~Folks  `are in a rut of` consuming what ~~the~~ nature ~~have~~ has given to us,overlook~~ing~~ the magnitude of conservation. There exists a basic canon that the sustainable exploitation of  ~~nature~~ecosystem ~~lies in~~ ~~cautious~~ needs *painstaking* ~~protection~~ care other than collective indifference.The man-nature relationship is not `a one-way street` as most of us think it ought to .

~~For this reason~~To this end,we should `leave no stone unturned` to reduce the production of  man-made pollutants and ease the burden ~~of~~`on` our habitats.Also`,`a perpetuating policy  to be enforced is required for it does have a generational cost to build a nourishing and vibrant home.

flow 流动 液体 →   drift 漂浮，固态  
cautious protection 谨慎的保护 → painstacking care 悉心的呵护

Here's the rub. As the image vividly portrays, we seniors ~~feel~~are dazzled ~~in~~`by` the dilemma ~~to seek~~ of seeking out our becoming avenues ~~with the looming of graduation~~`as` graduation looms. This suggests the magnitude of `judiciousness` in decision-making.

~~Keeping~~Maintainig subjectivity is `undeniably` the cornerstone to form life-altering decisions. Specifically，it orders us to take individual characters，aspirations，capabilities alike into consideration and engineer `a` prudent and rational ~~schedual~~schedule in turn. Nevertheless, it's easier said than down. The majority of us are in the rut of task-oriented way,either dwarfing the ~~positivities~~ positives and grits in unknown facets, or glued to idealism, can't meet the demands of fast-moving reality. Thus, it does not feel like a stretch to emphasis the significance of subjective initiative, which promises to cultivate superiority in cut-throat contests. 

In a nutshell, since multi-choice has become the cut and dried fact, riding the tide and harness the opportunities should take precedence over flying blind to forge ahead with a bright future.

But for the image above, the significant role of grit in a journey would be barely perceptible. As it vividly portrays, two youngsters, at the steps to the mountain peak, act vary.One frowns, pretending to give up, while another shares a bottle of water with his partner, managing to nudge him ahead.  Behind such a phenomenon buried an essence in the lack of persistence.

Admittedly, we can justify our abruption easily through the guise of an exhausted figure, sitting in the comfort area in a rut.  Nevertheless, it goes at the cost of chances ahead, slamming the door towards latent possibilities. Actually, the world is huge enough for opting for an alternative, which promises to reach the terminak and gear up for a new one in turn.  To achieve this aim, it orders us to cultivate courage and resolution in facing perpetuated trips in life.

In a nutshell, a determined heart in a journey is vital to each phase in life.  To paraphrase an idiom, life goes in its way, having nothing to do with your stop.

The image vividly depicts a conversation between a son and his father, raising concerns about the clash of individuality and shared identity.    The child, disguised as the Monkey King, complained bitterly that many of his class found the play tedious.    "Your favorite is the sufficient reason to do it.   "consoles his father in turn. 

At first glance, this is simply a common growing-up setback.    Deep down, the not-to-be-negligible dilemmas can be found `in` how we seek out and develop our own hobbies.    Admittedly, we can be carefree, swept `along` by the tide of sound around us, engaged in the entertainments peddled by the majority.     It does not feel like a stretch to say that this is precisely what most people do in a rut.   Still, we, by contrast, have an alternative in seeking inwardness and devoting ourselves to beloved causes, which do bolster inner `contentment` and fuel `self-aggrandizement`.     Specifically, finding enthusiasm within oneself is not `a` form of narcissism, but rather a combination of wit to ruminate on identity and grit to remain independent.

In a nutshell, more attention could have been given to hobby development during the growth period.  Not just individuals, but entire communities would get a lot of that.

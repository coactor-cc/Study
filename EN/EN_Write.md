## 写作
作文的准备思路，如果你备考都没有思路的话你也离g不远了 

回忆高中作文的比拼：还是要积累语料，但是有没有可能我太在意用词的独特性，没注意标点，语法，书写这些基础
我觉得在高级表达上，经过准备不会欠缺，但作文的基本东西还是很需要纠正的，
1.练字(每天20min)×时间不够
2.审题技术
3.素材积累->形成装逼的语言：aspect个人品质，社会文化，科技，环境  
4.实践：行文思路、语法纠正、时间把控->check 提升->实践

The picture drips with sarcasm when it comes to how we treat our emvironment.The travellers are ~~throwing~~tossing trash around while boating on the lake,the remainders ~~flowing~~drifting at the surface.

Behind such phenomenon lies in our lack of environmental awareness.~~People~~Folks usually `in a rut of` consuming what ~~the~~ nature ~~have~~ has given to us,overlook~~ing~~ the magnitude of conservation. There exists a basic canon that the sustainable exploitation of  ~~nature~~ecosystem ~~lies in~~ ~~cautious~~ need(需要)*painstacking* ~~protection~~ care other than collective indifference.The man-nature relationship is not `a one way street` as most of us think it ought to .

For this reason,we should `leave no stone unturned` to reduce the production of  man-made pollutants to ease the burden of  our habitats.Also a perpetuating policy  to be enforced is required for it does have a generational cost to build a nourishing and vibrant home.



flow 流动 液体 →   drift 漂浮，固态  
cautious protection 谨慎的保护 → painstacking care 悉心的呵护


## 2022
The image vividly depicts a conversation between a son and his father, raising concerns about the clash of individuality and shared identity.    The child, disguised as the Monkey King, complained bitterly that many of his class found the play tedious.    "Your favorite is the sufficient reason to do it.   "consoles his father in turn. 

At first glance, this is simply a common growing-up setback.    Deep down, the not-to-be-negligible dilemmas can be found `in` how we seek out and develop our own hobbies.    Admittedly, we can be carefree, swept `along` by the tide of sound around us, engaged in the entertainments peddled by the majority.     It does not feel like a stretch to say that this is precisely what most people do in a rut.   Still, we, by contrast, have an alternative in seeking inwardness and devoting ourselves to beloved causes, which do bolster inner `contentment` and fuel `self-aggrandizement`.     Specifically, finding enthusiasm within oneself is not `a` form of narcissism, but rather a combination of wit to ruminate on identity and grit to remain independent.

In a nutshell, more attention could have been given to hobby development during the growth period.  Not just individuals, but entire communities would get a lot of that.
